# GraphQL API Administrator Panel

This repository contains a GraphQL API that serves as an administrator panel for managing data. The API is implemented in Python and uses the popular GraphQL library and Flask web framework. Flask-GraphQL is also used to integrate GraphQL into Flask. 

## To get started:

To start using the API, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/Mapacherama/GraphQL-API-Administrator-Panel.git

Install the dependencies using pipenv:

    pipenv install

Start a pipenv shell:

    pipenv shell

Run the API: 

    export FLASK_APP=app
    flask run

The API will be running on http://localhost:5000/graphql. You can use a GraphQL client like Insomnia to start making queries and mutations to the API.
